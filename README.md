#  Underwater-Image-Enhancement-and-Debris-Detection


### Project Setup Guide

clone the project using 


     git clone https://github.com/Anandhu-Jayan/Underwater-Image-Enhancement-and-Debris-Detection
cd into the new folder and type


    npm install

This installs the required dependencies

To run the React project.


    npm start

Install the python dependencies and clone the detectron2 model from [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2 "here")

##### Image Enhancement was implemented from the following reasearch work
[The Retinex based improved underwater image enhancement](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11042-020-09752-2 "The Retinex based improved underwater image enhancement")

Detectron2 Mask RCNN was used for instance segmentation , the following research work was also helpful [[1]],[[2]]
